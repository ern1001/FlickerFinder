# LED Flicker Finder

This app helps to locate flickering LED bulbs.

Sometimes a defective LED bulb may flicker intermittently. 
If you have many LED bulbs in a room, it may be difficult to determine which 
bulb is at fault. Some LED bulbs produce a slight flicker every few minutes 
that is difficult to notice by eye. Turn on this app and place your phone 
on a flat surface (screen facing up) directly under the suspected LED bulb.

The Light Intensity field displays the current light intensity, in lux, measured
by the light sensor in your phone. Typically a light intensity of 100 lux or
more is needed for the app to work best. Every time a flicker is detected, the
app will make a beep, counts the flicker event, and keeps track of the maximum
flicker level (in percent) detected.

Press the Reset button to reset the Flicker Event counter, Max Flicker level
and Minute timer Adjust your phone volume control as desired to hear each
flicker event.
If you don't want to hear the beep, just tap the "Mute" checkbox. 

If you walk near the phone, you may cast a shadow that produces a false flicker. 
Press the Reset button if you want to reset the Flicker Event counter and the 
Max Flicker level detected. 

Let the app run for many
minutes and see if any flicker events are detected. For example, if your eyes
notice a flicker every 5 minutes, you should run the app for 15 minutes (3
times the typical flicker period) under each LED bulb that you are checking.  Then try placing the phone under another LED
bulb, press "Reset" and again wait many minutes to see if any flicker
events are detected for that LED. Repeat the process for each LED bulb. The
bulb that produces the largest flicker percentage is probably the LED bulb that
needs to be replaced. 

Settings: 
Adjust the Flicker Threshold to the lowest level that does not report false
flicker events. Usually a setting in the range of 2% to 10% works well. You can
test it by passing your hand over the top of the phone while the app is
running.  

Notes: 
Some phone light sensors are more responsive than others. The update rate of
your phone's light sensor is shown near the bottom of the Settings screen.  
Your phone's light sensor should have an update rate of at least 10 
updates/second in order to detect flickers - faster is better.

If your phone's light sensor is slower than this, you may be able to detect
long flickers; but not be able to detect brief flickers.  
 
Some LED bulbs aretemperature or voltage sensitive and may go for a long 
period of time without flickering. However, under the right conditions, 
they start flickering more often. You can use this app accordingly to locate 
the faulty bulb when you notice that a bulb is flickering frequently. 

Some LED bulbs produce "micro-flickers" of 2% or less that are difficult to see 
and may not be objectionable. However, other bulbs can produce noticeable 
flickers of 20% or more. 

If you hold the phone in your hand while the app is running, it will likely
report false flicker events due to small hand movements that cause the light
intensity seen by the sensor to change. 

Do not place the phone near a TV or other source of flickering light in the room, 
as this may cause false flicker events while you are testing. 
If your LED bulbs are bright, the app can be used during the day; but best 
results are obtained at night. 

The light sensor reading is updated rapidly multiple times each second. 
A flicker event is detected when the percent difference between sequential 
light readings exceeds the Flicker Threshold. 
This app intentionally keeps your phone screen alive while it is
running. 

This app is not a scientific instrument and is not suitable for professional, 
commercial or legal use for the determination or assessment of LED bulb flickering.

I hope that you enjoy this app - Roger Noar, KN7RN, www.rayonics.com .
